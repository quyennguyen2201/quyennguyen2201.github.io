I am a climate economist with seven years of experience in climate finance and data science. My research examines how transition and physical risks from climate change affect financial stability and property markets. I take an interdisciplinary approach, combining climate science and economics with technical expertise in machine learning, geospatial modelling, macroeconomic and agent-based modelling, and econometrics. These experiences position me as both an applied financial economist and a climate data scientist.

Currently, I work at **Earth Sciences New Zealand**, a New Zealand crown research institute with expertise in atmospheric, freshwater, marine research, as well as research on surface and subsurface of the Earth (September 2023-now). I also holds a honorary fellowship position at the **University of Otago** working on a MBIE Smart Idea project (2025-2027) entitled `"Financial stability and improved policies through spatio-temporal hybrid climate stress tests"` [(Link)](https://www.strand-lab.org/). This is a follow-on project from the **Royal Society Te Apārangi Marsden Fund project** [(Link)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/strandproject/) (2021-2024) at the University of Otago, entitled `"Should I stay or should I go? Climate-change risks to property values across space and time, and the related implications for financial stability"` where I work as a postdoctoral researcher in modelling the changes in climate-change flooding-related risks and how these risks changes over time in New Zealand.   

University of Otago is also where I finish my PhD thesis entitled `"Essays on climate finance transition risk"`, under the supervision of: Professor Ivan Diaz-Rainey, *Griffith University, AU*  [(Homepage)](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/40505-ivan-diazrainey), Dr Duminda Kuruppuarachchi, *University of Otago, NZ*  [(Homepage)](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago689207.html), and Dr Matthew McCarten, *University of Oxford, UK* [(Homepage)](http://matthewmccarten.com/). This thesis  involves the assessment of transitional risks (i.e. carbon emissions, climate disclosure, NetZero commitments) on the largest U.S. banks and SP500 companies. 

Prior to the graduate program, I have five years of working experience in insurance, finance & data analytics in the United States and in Vietnam. This includes 3 years in risk management role at **Intel Vietnam** (2010-2013), 1 year in data analytics at **MD24 USA** (2015-2016), 1 year in corporate finance in **Pfizer Vietnam** (2016-2017). I also interned at the Office of Chief Executive, **Ministry for the Environment New Zealand** one summer (Nov 2019 - Feb 2020). 

`Finance` is my specialty. During my MBA program, I worked as a student equity analyst for **Carlson Investment Fund** (2013-2015). This is a student investment fund that manages US$ 20 million in total asset under management with focus on small cap stocks. I helped calculating fund performance and sent investors updates on our performance every quarter. I also have completed the CFA Level I in 2015, and I have worked as a teaching assistant for several 200 and 300-level finance classes.  

`Data science` is my passion. I am aspired to apply machine learning algorithm and data analytic techniques in the decision making process. Recently, I developed my interest in geospatial modelling as I am enthusiastic about using satellite images, rasters, and shapes to study the evoluation of the Earth's system. I also tried `Large Language Models` to automate the analysis of climate risk disclosures. Outside of my work, I learnt to write codes and build algorithms from scratch.  

I am also inspired to mentor new students on the topics of climate economics and climate finance. In the past few years, I have involved in a few research projects where I helped MsC and PhD students on technical modelling.
