## JOURNAL ARTICLES: ####
1. Cox, S. C., Ettema, M. H., Chambers, L. A., Stephens, S. A., Bodeker, G. E., **Nguyen, Q.**, Diaz-Rainey, I., & Moore, A. B. (2025). [Empirical models of shallow groundwater and multi-hazard flood forecasts as sea-levels rise](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF004977). Earth’s Future, 13(2), e2024EF004977.

   `We develop empirical models linking shallow groundwater behaviour with coastal and pluvial flooding to produce multi-hazard flood forecasts under rising sea-levels. Using long-term groundwater observations, high-resolution topography, and hydrological modelling, we identify how elevated groundwater amplifies flood frequency and depth across coastal lowlands. Our multi-hazard framework integrates groundwater, rainfall, and storm-surge drivers to generate probabilistic flood forecasts under projected sea-level rise. Results show that shallow groundwater contributes substantially to future inundation risk, with compounding effects during extreme rainfall and coastal surge events. These findings highlight the importance of groundwater monitoring and integrated hazard modelling for long-term climate risk assessment and adaptation planning`
   
3. **Nguyen, Q.,** Diaz-Rainey, I., Kitto, A., McNeil, B., Pittman, N., & Zhang, R. (2022). [Scope 3 Emissions: Data Quality and Machine Learning Prediction Accuracy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521922003945).   *PLOS Climate*, 2(11), e0000208.

   `This paper explores the quality of Scope 3 emission data in terms of divergence and composition and the performance of machine learning models in predicting Scope 3 emissions. We do so using datasets from three major providers (Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon, ISS). We find considerable divergence between providers—even for identical reported values—making it difficult for investors to understand their exposure to Scope 3 emissions. We also find that machine learning can improve prediction accuracy for total Scope 3 emissions (up to 6%) and for individual categories when estimated separately and aggregated (up to 25%). Upstream emissions are easier to predict than downstream emissions. Prediction is limited by sparse observations in several categories and varying predictor importance. We conclude that users should consider data source, quality, and prediction errors when using third-party Scope 3 datasets.`

4. **Nguyen, Q.**, Diaz-Rainey, I., & Kuruppuarachchi, D. (2023).[In search of climate distress risk](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521922003945). *International Review of Financial Analysis*, 85, 102444.

   `Using the Merton distance-to-default model, we examine whether climate risk affects firms’ default risk for S&P 500 non-financial firms (2010–2019). Climate transition risk disclosures reduce distance to default, while physical or general climate risk disclosures do not. Corporate carbon footprints show inconsistent and generally insignificant effects. The negative effect of transition risk is stronger in states with carbon pricing (California and RGGI) and temporarily strengthens after the 2015 Paris Agreement, though the effect fades over time.`
   
6. **Nguyen, Q.,** Diaz-Rainey, I., Kuruppuarachchi, D., McCarten, M., & Tan, E. K. (2023).[Climate transition risk in US loan portfolios: Are all banks the same?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521922003519). *International Review of Financial Analysis*, 85, 102401.

   `We examine banks’ exposure to climate transition risk using a loan-level approach combining machine learning carbon footprint predictions and climate stress testing. Large US banks hold limited coal exposure (0.4%) but substantial exposure to oil, gas, and electricity borrowers (13.5% combined). Transition risk exposure is relatively stable over time, with reductions following the Paris Agreement. Stress-test losses equal 0.5% of US syndicated loans (4.1% of CET1 capital), doubling under 1.5°C scenarios. Tail risks are substantial (up to 62% of CET1). Climate risk interacts strongly with traditional borrower financial risk.`

7. **Nguyen, Q.**, Thorsnes, P., Diaz‐Rainey, I., Moore, A., Cox, S., & Stirk‐Wang, L. (2022).[Price recovery after the flood: Risk to residential property values from climate change‐related flooding](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8489.12471). *Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics*, 66(3), 532–560.

   `Using a unique combination of a 2015 severe rain event and a minimum-floor-level (MFL) policy change in Dunedin, New Zealand, we analyse property market responses to climate-related flooding. Homes in MFL zones sold at a 5% discount pre-flood, which briefly tripled in flooded areas but disappeared within 15 months. Results suggest short memory among buyers or limited long-term change in perceived hazard risk.`

8. **Nguyen, Q.,** Diaz-Rainey, I., & Kuruppuarachchi, D. (2021).[Predicting corporate carbon footprints for climate finance risk analyses: A machine learning approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321000347). *Energy Economics*, 95, 105129.

   `Corporations face rising pressure to disclose and reduce GHG emissions, yet only a subset report footprints. We develop a two-step framework using Meta-Elastic Net to ensemble multiple ML models, improving prediction accuracy by up to 30% compared with existing approaches. Accuracy further improves with sector-specific disclosures and energy data. Results inform policymakers on where to prioritise improved reporting and help investors better estimate transition risk.`
